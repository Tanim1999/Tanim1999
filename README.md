## <DIV>My recent projects:</DIV>

### 1. Awesome Blog
 It was a really fun project to work on. It's a full stack project where i used :

 <b>Front-end</b>: React, Tailwind,Daisy Ui, Tanstack query, Axios, React-router-dom.


 <b>Authentication:</b> Firebase


 <b>Back-end:</b> Express,MongoDb 


 Basically it's a blogging website. Users can create blog and post them which is available to everyone. To see the blog details amd add to wish list you have to sign up. You can see all the blog details after logging in and comment on them. You can't comment on your own blog. You can edit your blog after clicking blog details.For authentication firebase is used.  
 In the home page recent 5 blogs are shown. In the featured blog page the blogs are ranked base on word count.
 In the all blogs page you can search blogs by title, beside this you can sort them based on category.  

 For more info visit the repositories linked down below. You can also visit the website from the live link below

### 2. Dream Asset Hub
This a full stack project and my most advanced project so far. Here i used follwing technologies:

<b>Front-end</b>: React, Tailwind,Daisy Ui, Tanstack query, Axios, React-router-dom.


 <b>Authentication:</b> Firebase
 <b>Payment method:</b> Stripe


 <b>Back-end:</b> Express,MongoDb 

 This is my biggest work so far. It's an asset management website. Here asset management service is sold. Users can join as an admin or employee. Admin can increase his team member limit by buying selected package. Admin can add asset and approve or reject requests made by employee and the whole life cycle of an asset is recorded. Employees can track the status of his/her requested asset and return it if the asset is returnable. Beside that there are interesting features like upcoming birthdays of team mates. So overall it's a very useful website to manage the assets of a company.
